# generic-flonum
Racket package for various IEEE-754 floating point formats

This library provides an alternate interface to MPFR (compared to [math/bigfloat](http://docs.racket-lang.org/math/bigfloat.html)), emphasizing the
emulation of floating-point formats such as `binary128`, `binary16`, `bfloat16`, etc.
